\## Getting the Teekkari Cap and Freshman Passes


An essential part of new student orientation is the freshman pass. These passes contain a list for each new student of everything that is included in our community's activities. The tasks in the passes vary between guilds, but their main purpose is to familiarize students with the activities and encourage participation in events and occasions organized throughout the year. After completing the pass, a freshman becomes a teekkari and receives their cap on Walpurgis Eve.
