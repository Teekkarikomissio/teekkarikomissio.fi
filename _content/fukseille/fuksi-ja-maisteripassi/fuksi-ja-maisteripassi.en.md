## Fresher's and Master's Pass

An essential part of new student orientation is the fresher pass. These passes contain a list for each new student of everything that is included in our community's activities. The tasks in the passes vary between guilds, but their main purpose is to familiarize students with the activities and encourage participation in events and occasions organized throughout the year. After completing the pass, a fresher becomes a teekkari and receives their cap on Wappu Eve.

Fresher pass is aimed for first year bachelor students. Master pass is meant for master level students who have passed bachelor studies somewhere else. Despite different life situations, masters students are able to familiarize with teekkari culture and earn teekkari caps with help of master pass.
