## What is a fresher?


Fresher refers to first year engineering students. It is called *fuksi* in Finnish and *gulis* in Swedish. Teekkarifreshers will receive their overalls but no teekkari caps yet. They are filling in fresher's passes during the first academic year and attend Eldprowet in order to receive teekkari caps.
