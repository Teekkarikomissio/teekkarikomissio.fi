## Orientation week

Orientation week, also called fresher week, is aimed for freshers before the actual studies begin. The first year engineering students are introduced to university studies and student association activities by tutors and tutor captains. The main idea is to help the new students to feel like home in the new environment.

### Teekkari culture lectures

Teekkarikomissio offers to member guilds a chance for teekkari culture lectures. A Board member, usually Teekkari Culture Commissary or Chair of the Board, lectures about teekkari culture and Teekkarikomissio. The idea is to welcome teekkari freshers to the teekkari community and strengthen the teekkari identity. Lectures are usually given at the orientation week.
