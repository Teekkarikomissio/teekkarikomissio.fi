# Annual ball



Annual balls are the fanciest academic parties. The meaning is to invite members and special guests together and celebrate the association that has become older. As its name reveals, the annual ball takes place once a year or even more seldom.

Traditionally they consist of a cocktail party, a dinner party and an after party. The dress code is white tie with academic decorations. Alternatively annual ball can be replaced with annual ball sitz party. It is a fancier sitz party compared to a regular sitz party.

The cocktail party is meant for greetings and gifts. Especially the invited guests tend to give gifts and greetings to the board of guild that is being celebrated. Åbo Akademi Universitys associations have a separated solenn akt where invited guests give gifts and greetings. Solenn akt is followed by a cocktail party where all the guests may socialize with each other.

Cocktail is followed by a dinner party that differs clearly from sitz parties. A three course dinner is accompanied by singing, speeches and giving badges of honour to distinguished actors. Popular afterparty activities are for example dancing, live music or singing karaoke. 

Teekkarikomissio is used to have an annual ball every fifth year. The next time is going to be September 2025.
