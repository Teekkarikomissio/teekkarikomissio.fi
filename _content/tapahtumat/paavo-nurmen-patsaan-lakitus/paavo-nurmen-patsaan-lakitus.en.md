## Paavo Nurmi Cap Ceremony

The Paavo Nurmi Cap Ceremony takes place on Wappu Eve after the capping of the Lilja statue by TYY at 19.00. The capping will gather several thousand people on the riverbank to watch the crane move as it lifts the TK Chair of the Board, the Vice Chair of the Board and the guest of honour next to the statue. The event will include speeches and the presentation of the Varsinainen Tekniikan Teko - Egentliga Teknik Dådet award. Naturally, the event will also include the capping of the statue itself. The event often includes musical performances.
