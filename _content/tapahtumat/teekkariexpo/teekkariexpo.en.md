## TeekkariExpo

TeekkariExpo is an exhibition where the most important partners of Teekkari Commission, such as member associations and local technology companies, can be met. Representatives of associations are available at their stands where they tend to sell overall batches and other merch. Companies tell about themselves and vacancies. The event is traditionally held at University hill in September.
