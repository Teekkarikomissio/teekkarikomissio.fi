# Eldprowet



Eldprowet is a traditional and annual event for teekkari freshers. The meaning is to familiarize with local teekkari culture and actors. An important aspect of this is to get to know the teekkari guilds and students of the different university in Turku. Eldprowet is arranged by the Teekkarikomissio on Wappu and it is a central part of deserving teekkari cap. We will not reveal more but everyone must experience that personally. ;)
