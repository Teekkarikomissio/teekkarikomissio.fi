## Jäynä Gala

The local jäynä competition of Turku reaches climax in the Jäynä Gala, where all of the jäynä documentations are watched together. The practical jokes are reviewed and given credit or criticism. In the event, Teekkarikomissio announces the winners of each series in the competition (open, fresher and guild series) and the winners are awarded. Even shame diplomas will be given to guilds that have not attended the guild series in given time.
