## Teekkari Cap Ceremony

Since 2022, the Teekkari Cap Ceremony of all Turku's teekkari freshers has been held on the steps of the Turku Cathedral on Wappu Eve. The joint capping starts at 12 noon. The caps are ceremonially distributed to the freshmen according to the age order of the guilds. The programme will also include speeches and awards ceremonies. In addition to the staircase programme, the carnival atmosphere will be created by the stands of the organizations and faculties in the Cathedral Square. The capping is primarily organized by the Cultural Commissioner of the Teekkarikomissio's board, together with the fresher representatives of the member organizations.
