# TK sitz party


The TK sitz is an event organized by the Teekkarikomissio, intended as a joint sitz for all technology student guilds in Turku. The aim of the TK sitz is to bring together technology students from Turku, helping them form new relationships, reduce language barriers and introduce participants to the sitz traditions of the other university. The program for the TK sitz often incorporates elements from the sitz cultures of both universities, which can be seen in the songs, the customs or even in the food served.

Some popular TK sitz events in the past have included the Rymd-sitz (Space sitz) held in fall 2023, a collaboration between TK and Kemistklubben. Additionally, the Teekkarikomissio held its first fresher sitz in fall 2024, allowing Turkuâ€™s teekkari to get to know other freshers from different guilds from both universities early in their studies.
