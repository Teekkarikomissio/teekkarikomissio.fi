## Teekkari Dipping

On May Day 1966, Finland’s first Teekkari Dipping was held in Tammerkoski, Tampere. Since then, this tradition has become a significant part of teekkari student culture and has spread to many other engineering student cities in Finland, including Turku. In Turku, the first Teekkari Dipping took place in the Aura River on 1.5.2022, at Itäinen Rantakatu 48.

The Teekkari Dipping symbolizes the moment when first-year students leave behind their fresher status and officially become technology students. Hundreds of Turku’s engineering students have already taken the dipping in the inviting waves of the Aura River, and this event has quickly become an important tradition for Turku’s engineering students.

The dipping is organized by a committee assembled by the Teekkarikomissio, which usually consists of members from Turku’s engineering student guilds. In addition to the dipping committee, divers, first aid personnel, volunteers, security personnel and a crane operator participate in the event, making it a result of a broad collaboration. In 2024, the teekkari dipping was relocated to Läntinen Rantakatu 17 and it attracted hundreds of spectators.

Each fall, the Teekkarikomissio opens applications for the dipping committee, and in spring, freshmen can register to take part in the dipping.
