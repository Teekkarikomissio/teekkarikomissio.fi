# Spectacles


Teekkaris tend to arrange events where they influence and are visible in a positive way. Tempaus or spectacle represent active citizenship that is a part of teekkari culture. Teekkaris are trying to take initiative and be an active part of society. Examples of spectacles in Turku are voting campaigns and blood donatings. Spectacles can be arranged together with students studying different subjects. Student unions have also arranged spectacles of the same kind in history. If teekkaris want to arrange a spectacle together, they may ask permission to wear a teekkari cap at the event.
