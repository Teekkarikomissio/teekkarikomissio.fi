## Little Wappu

Pikkuwappu, or Little Wappu, is an event organized to honor the ending of the teekkari cap season. Pikkuwappu is organized every year on 30.9. The event includes traditions such as steaming the cap’s tassel and dipping its tip into a sweet liquor called punch. There are also speeches about being a teekkari, and announcing the winner of the cycling race Kilometrikilpailu. The event ends at midnight when Ikuisen teekkarin laulu is sung and the caps are lowered on the bearers’ shoulder to rest for the winter season.
