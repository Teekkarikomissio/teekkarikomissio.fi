# Jäynä Start


In Jäynä Start, Teekkarikomissio announces the opening of the Jäynä Competition, liberally translated to “practical joke competition”. The Jäynä Competition goes on from the Jäynästart to the end of March or the beginning of April. Jäynästart consists of going through the rules of the competition, and reminds what is a good Jäynä. To give rise to inspiration, practical jokes from the past are watched together. The different series will also be announced.
