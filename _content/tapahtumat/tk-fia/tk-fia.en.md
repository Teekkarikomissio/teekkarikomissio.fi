## TK-FIA

In the depths of Borgen was FIA once invented. Played by Kemistklubben for decades, it has held its place as an iconic game for the Åbo Akademi teekkaris. Fortunately for everyone studying in the University of Turku, has Kemistklubben given us the opportunity to organise our own version of said game for all of the teekkaris under Teekkarikomissio.

TK-FIA is organised yearly around November. It is organised jointly by Teekkarikomissio and Kemistklubben, and it truly is open for all of our members. Judging from the fact that the registration form fills up in mere minutes or from the fact that the feedback is astonishingly good, we would definitely recommend everyone takes part, if it feels like something you would enjoy.

More information about the event can be found closer to the event as we do not want to ruin the surprise for you!
