Nucleus ry is a student association for biotechnology students at University of Turku. Nucleus was founded in 2008 and is therefore the second oldest engineering student association at University of Turku.

Members, also called nuggets, can be identified by their electric blue overalls decorated with orange sponsor prints and a white logo on back. The head of the board does also wear a frack made of an overall.

Depending on the interests of its members, Nucleus also runs various clubs: a cooking club for cooking and baking, a brewing club for fermentation and a craft club for craft evenings such as badge sewing.

One of the most important events of the year is rekomBIOnaatio, which brings together biotechnology students from all over Finland for a weekend in the same city.
