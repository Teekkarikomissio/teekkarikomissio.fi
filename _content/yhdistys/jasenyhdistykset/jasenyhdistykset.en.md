However, guild members can usually be found in Aurum's TFIF&TEK lounge where the board offers coffee from monday to thursday. Axels (men) and Stinas (women), as the members call themselves, can be identified by their self-dyed tropical green overalls with figures Axel and Stina printed on the back.

Traditional events include for example themed sitz parties, excursions at home and abroad, FIA Cup, the company exhibition ASINDA (Axels och Stinas industridag) and the annual ball week. Kemistklubben has links with sister guilds in Sweden (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan KTH in Stockholm) and Norway (Høiskolens Chemikerforening HC in Trondheim). It is customary to visit each other during their annual ball weeks.

Members of Kemistklubben are also automatically members of the independent association Axels Sportklubb rf (ASK), which organizes sports and outdoor activities such as excursions, weekly sports classes and CampusSport tournaments. ASK owns a cottage in Parainen, which is also available for rent to others at an affordable price.
