Teekkarikomissio (TK) is a coordinating contact forum for the teekkari associations in Turku. TK is a bilingual association. The members of the Teekkarikomission are Kemistklubben, DaTe, Digit, Nucleus, Adamas, Machina, Asklepio, Optima and Efficio.

The association maintains cooperation between the University of Turku and the Åbo Akademi technology students and is responsible for the maintenance and development of Turku's teekkari culture. In addition to its member organizations, the association maintains relations with the faculties, student unions, teekkari associations and student unions in other localities, as well as with local graduate engineering associations and alumni clubs.

The most visible events of the Teekkarikomissio are the Joint Capping and the capping of the statue of Paavo Nurmi on Wappu Eve, and the Teekkari dipping on Wappu Day. In addition, TK organizes local jäynä competitions, Eldprowet for freshers, PikkuWappu, sitz parties and other events.

Teekkarikommissio was founded on 27 April 2000. Kemistklubben vid Åbo Akademi rf had long been the only teekkari organization in Turku until the new IT subject associations Datateknologerna vid Åbo Akademi rf and Digit ry were founded in autumn 1999. Thus the need arose to create a common umbrella organization for all the teekkari guilds in Turku. One of the main reasons for setting up the association was to manage the teekkari cap of Turku, which was previously the responsibility of Kemistklubben. Jäynä competitions were also at the heart of the association's activities from the very beginning. Nucleus became a member of TK in 2008. In the 2020s, the membership of Teekkarikomissio has multiplied as new guilds have been founded.
