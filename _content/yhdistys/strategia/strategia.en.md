The Teekkarikomissio Strategy was implemented for the first time for the years 2022-2024. The strategy is always developed for the upcoming three years. It includes the most important values and spearheads for the association, meaning specific areas of activity that are intended for long-term development, regardless of the annual change of the board. The Teekkarikomissio board interprets the strategy annually, and the idea is that the strategy is concretely reflected in the association's activities through the action plan.
